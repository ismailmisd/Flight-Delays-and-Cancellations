# Flight-Delays-and-Cancellations

## Introduction
this is my Udacity's Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree graduation project

it is a visual analysis in tableau to the Flight Delays and Cancellations 

## Project Description

In this project, I create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. 

I create data visualizations that tell a story and  highlight patterns in the data set

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015

You can find the dataset in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays) as well as it is in the project's file

## Project's file
the project has
* three xlsx files for the row data
* one main pdf file for the project that contain a detailed information


## Project formatting
Each insight in the pdf file consists of

* links   : which is the reference link to the visualization in my tableau public profile 
* summary : which is a description to the visualization and which charts I used and what is the insights it deliver
* design  : where I show the technical skills I used and design choices I made
